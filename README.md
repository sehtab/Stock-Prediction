# Stock-Prediction
This project is performed in two models:

   *LSTM
   *Monte Carlo Simulation

The models are performed from a dataframe which is extracted from yahoo finance for Apple Inc.

# LSTM

Dataframe is extracted from yahoo finance for Apple Inc. Then dataframe is cleaned and modified for LSTM model.After calculating RMSE, LSTM model is visualized.

# Monte-Carlo Simulation

After webscraping, dataframe is modified for Monte-Carlo simulation and 1000 random walk is performed.
